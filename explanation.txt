types.txt:
    (id, type_1, type_2)



evolves.txt:
    (id, from_id, to_id)

    examples: 
        2 evolves from 1 and into 3
        151 doesn't evolve from or to anything 
        133 can evolve into 134, 135, or 136
            script to choose evolution?



evolves
	select p.name, p2.name from evolves e join pokemon p using(id) left outer join pokemon p2 on to_id = p2.id;

evolves with from types
	select p.name, p2.name, type_1, type_2 from evolves e join pokemon p using(id) left outer join pokemon p2 on to_id = p2.id join pokemon_type using(id);

evolves with all types
	select p.name, t1.type_1, t1.type_2, p2.name, t2.type_1, t2.type_2 from evolves e join pokemon p using(id) left outer join pokemon p2 on to_id = p2.id join pokemon_type t1 using(id) left outer join pokemon_type t2 on to_id = t2.id;
